What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I found this assignment to be a clear and easy introduction into oop. The main issue I had with this assignment was poor timing, as I believed it to be due on Thursday rather than Tuesday. However, this is an extremely avoidable issue for future assignments. Additionally, I had to do research on the __repr__ code due to issues making my computer objects unrecognizable to other modules. For future students, I would let them know about this and the similar __str__ method.
